We welcome the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034 adopted by the General Assembly on 24 December 2024,1 which builds on the progress achieved under the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries 2 and the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u201320243 and provides a renewed and action- oriented framework to support the efforts of landlocked developing countries in achieving sustainable development. I. Global context and shared commitments We gather at a critical juncture marked by overlapping global challenges, including geopolitical tensions and conflicts, food and energy crises, high transportation and trade costs, high interest rates, inflation, high indebtedness, climate change, disasters, biodiversity loss, desertification, melting glaciers and pollution. We stress the specific needs and challenges faced by landlocked developing countries due to the lack of direct territorial access to the sea, obstacles to transport and communication, long distances from major markets, cumbersome transit procedures and the lack of adequate, safe, affordable, accessible infrastructure, and recognize the need for strengthened international solidarity to support their structural transformation, industrialization, economic diversification and full integration into the regional and global economy. We recall that 2025 was proclaimed by the General Assembly as the International Year of Peace and Trust,4 and recognize that there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development \u2013 that is also relevant for landlocked developing countries. We recognize that, despite some positive results in certain areas of the Vienna Programme of Action, progress fell short, and note with concern that a severe financing deficit, in particular for infrastructure, limited data and technical capacity constraints undermined progress in achieving the goals and targets set out in the Vienna Programme of Action. We further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our efforts for the full and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 5 and its Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change6 and the Paris Agreement,7 the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,8 the New Urban Agenda9 and the Convention on Biological _______________ 1 Resolution 79/233, annex; see also resolution 79/279. 2 Report of the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries and International Financial and Development Institutions on Transit Transport Cooperation, Almaty, Kazakhstan, 28 and 29 August 2003 (A/CONF.202/3), annex I. 3 Resolution 69/137, annex II. 4 See resolution 78/266. 5 Resolution 70/1. 6 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 7 Adopted under the UNFCCC in FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21. 8 Resolution 69/283, annex II. 9 Resolution 71/256, annex.

We also uphold and will advance all commitments in the 2002 Monterrey Consensus14 and the 2008 Doha Declaration,15 as well as the relevant commitments in the Pact for the Future. 16 We note the interest and commitment of the landlocked developing countries to develop a dedicated work programme on landlocked developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We welcome the convening of the twenty-ninth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement in Baku, Azerbaijan in November 2024, as the first session of the Conference of the Parties held in a landlocked developing country, and the adoption of their decisions by Parties.

II. Implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034 We strongly commit ourselves to the full implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034 throughout the coming decade in line with its five mutually reinforcing priority areas: (a) Structural transformation and science, technology and innovation; _______________ 10 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1760, No. 30619. 11 United Nations Environment Programme, document CBD/COP/15/17, decision 15/4, annex. 12 Resolution 79/323, annex. 13 Resolution 69/313, annex. 14 Report of the International Conference on Financing for Development, Monterrey, Mexico, 18\u201322 March 2002 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.02.II.A.7), chap.

A/RES/80/3 Awaza Political Declaration 25-16680 4/5 (b) Trade, trade facilitation and regional integration; (c) Transit, transport and connectivity; (d) Enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change and disasters; (e) Means of implementation. We reaffirm our commitment to advancing the concrete deliverables outlined in the Awaza Programme of Action, with respect to establishing regional agriculture research hubs, based on interest expressed by some countries; creating a high-level panel of experts on freedom of transit for landlocked developing countries; and exploring the establishment of an infrastructure investment finance facility for landlocked developing countries. We emphasize the significance of declaring the United Nations Decade of Sustainable Transport for the 10-year period beginning on 1 January 2026, in particular for landlocked developing countries and transit countries, and look forward to an implementation plan for the Decade. We stress the importance of developing trade-related physical and digital infrastructure and facilitating inclusive, equitable and affordable connectivity for landlocked developing countries, and in this regard we invite multilateral development banks to increase investment in infrastructure, including roads, railways, waterways and ports, energy transit and connectivity infrastructure, as well as digital infrastructure, such as fibre-optic cables and satellite-based systems. Partnerships and support mechanisms We invite the landlocked developing countries, transit countries, their development partners, the United Nations system and all other relevant stakeholders to implement the relevant actions, agreed upon in the Awaza Programme of Action in its five priority areas, in a coordinated, coherent and expeditious manner consistent with national priorities. We invite the governing bodies of the United Nations funds and programmes and other multilateral organizations, including multilateral development banks and other international and regional financial institutions, as well as the World Trade Organization, to contribute to the implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action and to integrate it into their work programmes, as appropriate and in accordance with their relevant mandates. We also acknowledge the role of multilateral development banks in catalysing private investment and encourage the provision of increased concessional finance for infrastructure development to landlocked developing countries, encouraging them to enhance access to digital trade finance to help to narrow the trade finance gap. We welcome the growing role of South-South and triangular cooperation, as a complement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, peer learning and regional integration as enablers for resilience-building, innovation and cross-border cooperation. Governance, accountability and monitoring We underscore that national leadership and ownership of development strategies and policies of landlocked developing countries, transit countries and development partners must be ensured during the whole process of implementation, follow-up and monitoring. Awaza Political Declaration A/RES/80/3 5/5 25-16680 We call for closer coordination between the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States and United Nations country teams in landlocked developing countries, as an important tool for follow-up to and review of the implementation of provisions of the Awaza Programme of Action, underlining that the Office should be provided with adequate resources to fulfil its mandate, including through the existing trust fund. We also stress the critical importance of the more proactive role of United Nations agencies, including through the United Nations resident coordinators and country teams, in mobilizing all stakeholders to help Governments of landlocked developing countries to address the challenges caused by those countries\u2019 structural constraints. We emphasize that efficient and mutually complementary follow-up and monitoring mechanisms aligned with existing global frameworks and adapted at the national, subregional, regional and global levels are crucial for the successful implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action. III. Conclusion and call to action We declare our firm resolve to act urgently and collectively to deliver the commitments made in the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034. We request the Secretary-General to ensure the full mobilization and coordination of all relevant parts of the United Nations system to facilitate coordinated implementation and coherence in the follow-up to and monitoring of the Awaza Programme of Action at the national, subregional, regional and global levels. We call upon relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and invite international organizations and relevant regional and subregional organizations to integrate the Awaza Programme of Action into their programmes of work, as appropriate, within their respective mandates.

We recognize that the three core themes of social development, namely, poverty eradication, promotion of full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment therefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously. We share the conviction that social development and social justice are indispensable for the achievement and maintenance of peace and security within and among our nations. In turn, social development and social justice cannot be attained in the absence of peace and security or in the absence of respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms. We meet 30 years after the first World Summit for Social Development and days after the commemoration of the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations, with a determination to promote social development and social justice anchored in a strengthened and effective multilateral system, and we reaffirm and remain guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We recommit to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, as they remain relevant and valid, and the further initiatives for social development adopted by the General Assembly, including at its twenty-fourth special session,3 and to a continued global dialogue on social development issues. We reaffirm the full, timely and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, upholding all the principles enshrined in it, including the promise to leave no one behind and reach the furthest behind first, and to place people at the centre of development, with due consideration of the needs of present and future generations, and a strong commitment to safeguarding our planet. We also reaffirm the intergovernmental commitments related to social development, including those in the political declarations of the Sustainable Development Goals Summits held in 2019 and 2023, 4 as well as the relevant commitments in the Pact for the Future and its annexes.5 We reaffirm the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development6 as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. We are committed to its full implementation, which is critical for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and their targets. We welcome the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, the Sevilla Commitment, 7 which renews the global financing for development framework, building on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and call for its timely and effective implementation. We reaffirm that the pursuit and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, encompassing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, which includes the right to development, must be respected, protected and promoted, without distinction or discrimination of any kind. __________________ 3 Resolution S-24/2, annex. 4 Resolution 74/4, annex, and resolution 78/1, annex. 5 Resolution 79/1. 6 Resolution 69/313, annex. 7 Resolution 79/323, annex.

We stress the need to take urgent and ambitious climate action in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 8 and the Paris Agreement 9 in relation to climate mitigation, adaptation and the provision of the means of implementation, especially finance to developing countries. We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 10 including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof. We gather here in Doha at a summit of renewed hope, driven by commitment and collective action. While facing urgent and complex challenges, we see new opportunities. We are convinced that meaningful progress is possible through genuine solidarity, effective multilateralism and inclusive international cooperation, taking into account national realities and regional contexts, particularly in developing countries. We remain committed to a political, economic, ethical and spiritual vision for social development that is based on human dignity, human rights, equality, respect, peace, democracy, mutual responsibility and cooperation, and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people. We welcome the progress made towards the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action through concerted action at the national, regional and global levels. The global wealth of nations has grown significantly since 1995 and international trade has grown even more. Global labour productivity has increased, and the global unemployment rate has reached a historic low. Extreme poverty has been reduced and access to education, healthcare and social protection has improved considerably. Yet, 30 years after the convening of the World Summit for Social Development, progress remains slow and uneven, and major gaps and inequalities persist within and among countries. With only five years remaining until the 2030 deadline, progress towards achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals has been far too slow, with some goals stalled or even regressing despite notable advances in a few areas: (a) Although great strides have been made in reducing poverty since 1995, in recent years progress has slowed, and millions of people still live in extreme poverty and over 1 billion people endure poverty in different forms and dimensions. Children, women, persons with disabilities, people living in rural areas and those in vulnerable situations experience higher poverty rates than the rest of the population. Hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are still a reality, with global undernourishment rising in recent years. While access to education has expanded, still too many children are out of school; (b) In addition, while millions have been lifted out of poverty, billions of people live close to the poverty line and face a constant risk of falling into extreme poverty. Despite significant global progress in gradually expanding social protection __________________ 8 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 9 Adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Informal employment remains pervasive, with billions of people making their living in the informal economy. Women and young people are disproportionately engaged in informal and precarious employment. Furthermore, progress towards ending child labour is too slow; (d) Millions of youth do not have access to education, employment or training, the majority of whom are young women. In the labour market, young people, especially youth with disabilities, experience higher levels of unemployment, informal employment and working poverty. These decent work deficits can have long- lasting consequences on poverty eradication efforts and affect the well-being of current and future generations; (e) Today, inequality has reached staggering levels. Since 1995, income inequality has increased in many countries, developed and developing. Global wage gaps remain significant. Gender inequality is deeply entrenched. On average, women earn less than men and millions of women worldwide are outside the labour force; (f) Persons with disabilities continue to be more likely to live in poverty, are underemployed and unemployed, and face additional disability-related costs, including medical costs, as well as other significant and persistent social and economic barriers to inclusion in society; (g) Digital divides within and among countries persist, particularly in rural and remote areas. Billions of people currently do not have connectivity, access to the Internet and lack digital skills. Digital infrastructure, connectivity and access to the Internet in developing countries, particularly least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, remain challenging; (h) Multiple, persistent and new challenges are reversing social development gains, including geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, economic crises, inequalities within and among countries, climate change, natural hazards and disasters, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, water scarcity, desertification, pollution, conflict-induced famine and starvation, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement of people, refugee crisis, pandemics and other health emergencies, gender inequality, racial discrimination, uneven technological advancements, unsustainable debt burdens and unequal access to technology and capital; (i) Complex and interrelated opportunities, challenges and risks related to demographic shifts remain, including rapid population growth, declining birth rates and population ageing. Between 2024 and 2030, the number of persons aged 60 years or over is globally projected to outnumber youth, and this increase will be the greatest and the most rapid in the developing world. While these problems are global in character and affect all countries, we clearly acknowledge that each country faces specific challenges in its pursuit of sustainable development. We recognize the special challenges facing all developing countries, in particular, African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing middle-income countries and countries in conflict and post-conflict situations. We commit to support and implement the relevant development agendas, strategies and programmes of action for countries in special situations, including the Doha Political Declaration of the \u201cWorld Social Summit\u201d under the title \u201cthe Second World Summit for Social Development\u201d A/RES/80/5 5/18 25-17700 Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, 11 the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u2013 203412 and the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States, 13 and reaffirm our support for the achievement of the African Union Agenda 2063. We look forward to the elaboration of a specific inter-agency, comprehensive, system- wide response plan for middle-income countries by the United Nations development system. We are convinced that addressing today\u2019s challenges to social development requires strengthening international solidarity, upholding human rights, building trust, and a renewed commitment to multilateral action on the attainment of social development and the implementation of the sustainable development agenda in its social, economic and environmental dimensions. We will advance innovative solutions and inclusive international cooperation to fully translate the commitments of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action and the social dimension of the 2030 Agenda into concrete actions to achieve social development for all, in particular to the benefit of developing countries. We reaffirm that the Commission for Social Development has the primary responsibility for the follow-up to the Summit and review of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. We recognize that the multilateral system and its institutions, with the United Nations and its Charter at the centre, must be strengthened to keep pace with a changing world and address global challenges in the sphere of social development. They must be fit for the present and the future \u2013 effective and capable, just, democratic, equitable and representative of today\u2019s world, inclusive, interconnected and financially stable. We will explore bold and effective social policies that are woven into a whole- of-government, whole-of-society, people-centred and integrated approaches aimed at achieving social development for all, including through enhancing social policy coherence, building effective, accountable, transparent and inclusive institutions at all levels, achieving social justice for all, upholding democracy, the rule of law, good governance and access to justice, combating all forms of corruption and reinforcing national coordination, as well as multi-stakeholder engagement and integrated responses to social development challenges, and avoiding policy silos across sectors. We recognize the contributions of multi-stakeholder engagement to social development. We will continue to collaborate meaningfully with all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, social partners and the private sector, and encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships. On the basis of our common pursuit of social development, which is aimed at social justice, solidarity, harmony and equality, within and among countries, guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as well as policy objectives, development priorities and religious and cultural diversity, and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, we reaffirm our global drive for social progress and development. We strive for a future that is inclusive, resilient, sustainable and just.

A call to action We recommit ourselves to creating an enabling economic, political, social, cultural and legal environment to achieve social development for all. We will adopt a holistic approach towards the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including through addressing the challenges of extreme poverty and multidimensional poverty, address their disproportionate impact on countries in special situations and people in vulnerable situations and combat the feminization of poverty while ensuring that the focus is on building resilience to shocks and challenges, accelerating actions to eradicate poverty and avoiding relapsing back into it. In this regard we commit to: (a) Taking effective measures, including policies and programmes, to address the root causes of poverty and underlying causes of inequality, providing for the basic needs of all and increasing resilience for interconnected crises. These efforts should include the elimination of hunger and malnutrition; the provision of social protection, food security, education, livelihoods, employment, decent work for all, clean water and sanitation, adequate shelter and reliable health systems; and participation in social and cultural life, with special priority given to the needs and rights of women and children and persons in vulnerable situations, who often bear the greatest burden of poverty; (b) Reinforcing international development cooperation for developing countries\u2019 capacities to achieve poverty eradication, as well as the necessary measures to close financing gaps for poverty eradication and invest in capacity-building, technical assistance and programmes; (c) Exploring opportunities to mobilize additional finance, both public and private, through official development assistance-funded activities that are responsive to country needs and focused on long-term development and poverty eradication, while ensuring that additional private finance mobilized is not a substitute for existing commitments; (d) Ensuring sustainable and equitable financing for social protection systems as one of the enablers for eradicating poverty, reducing inequality and fostering social inclusion, as well as investing in programmes for eradicating poverty, including the feminization of poverty, to address underlying causes of inequality by promoting a sustainable economy for the well-being of all; (e) Integrating quality education as a core component of poverty reduction strategies, with focused efforts on access, equity and inclusion within a lifelong learning approach; (f) Advancing the transition from the informal to the formal economy, including the formalization of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises towards the eradication of poverty, creating decent jobs and catalysing social integration; (g) Strengthening social protection systems and reinforcing investment in measures, including social protection floors, and integrating financing of social protection systems and policies, including floors and policies in line with International Labour Organization recommendations and intergovernmental agreed standards, into country-led plans and strategies while providing support to developing countries that aim to increase social protection coverage, including those that aim to do so by at least two percentage points per year;

We also welcome the actions and efforts related to ending trafficking in persons, especially of women and children, contained in resolution 79/1 entitled \u201cThe Pact for the Future\u201d. We reaffirm the crucial importance of universal ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 5 and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,6 taking into consideration the central role of those instruments in the fight against trafficking in persons, and urge Member States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the Convention and the Protocol as a matter of priority. We urge States Parties to those instruments to implement them effectively, including through the Mechanism for the Review of the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto. We also reaffirm the importance of universal ratification and implementation of other relevant international instruments that address trafficking in persons, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child 7 and its optional protocols relevant to trafficking in persons.8 We recall the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, 9 the Global Compact on Refugees,10 and take note of Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women general recommendation No. 38 (2020) on trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration.11 We also reaffirm our recognition of the definition of trafficking in persons as set forth in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, as referenced in the Global Plan of Action and the subsequent Political Declarations. We reiterate our strong condemnation of trafficking in persons, which constitutes a serious crime and a grave offence to human dignity and physical integrity, a violation and abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and a challenge to sustainable development, and we note that respect for human rights is an important basis of comprehensive anti\u2011trafficking strategies. Combating trafficking in persons requires the implementation of a comprehensive approach that includes partnerships, international cooperation and measures to prevent trafficking, to identify and protect the victims, as well as a criminal justice response, including the investigation, prosecution and punishment of traffickers. In this regard, we encourage the development of policies, programmes and national strategies to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, we underline the importance of cooperation with civil society and we note the need to strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for more effective responses. _______________ 5 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2225, No. 39574. 6 Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. 7 Ibid., vol. 1577, No. 27531. 8 Ibid., vols. 2171 and 2173, No. 27531. 9 Resolution 73/195, annex. 10 Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-third Session, Supplement No. 12 (A/73/12 (Part I) and A/73/12 (Part II)), part II. 11 CEDAW/C/GC/38. 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons A/RES/80/9 3/8 25-19346 We commit to fulfil our obligations and intensify our efforts to prevent, address and eliminate the demand that fosters trafficking in persons, especially of women and children, for all forms of exploitation, and in this regard to put in place or enhance preventive measures, including legislative and other measures to deter exploiters, and those who facilitate or profit from the exploitation of trafficking victims, and hold them accountable. We reaffirm our commitment to address the social, economic, cultural, political and other factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking in persons, such as poverty, underdevelopment, unemployment, inequality, humanitarian emergencies, armed conflicts and natural disasters, sexual violence, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, social and financial exclusion and marginalization, as well as negative social norms, and a culture of tolerance towards violence against women, youth and children. We reiterate our commitment to promote education and awareness-raising campaigns to prevent trafficking in persons, and we welcome the designation of 30 July as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons.12 We express our serious concern over the significant and enduring trafficking of women and children, recognize that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects them. We note with concern potential cases of trafficking in women for the exploitation of surrogacy. We express grave concern about the increase in child trafficking, primarily for forced labour, forced marriage, sexual exploitation, and involvement in criminal activities. We note the specific vulnerabilities of children, including children and youth with disabilities and unaccompanied children, to various forms of exploitation, including in the context of travel, tourism and sports, and the need to address them, as well as the cultural practices that justify or tolerate their demand. We call upon Member States to enact or update national laws and establish comprehensive policies, programmes and other measures, as appropriate, that provide for the protection of trafficked women and children from revictimization and appropriate assistance and protection in the best interests of the child. We express solidarity with and compassion for victims and survivors, we call for full respect of their human rights and recognizing their role as agents of change in the global fight against trafficking in persons. We acknowledge the need to actively involve them, incorporating their perspective and experience in all efforts to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, including in designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating such efforts. We will provide victim-centred and trauma-informed care, assistance and services for their recovery and rehabilitation, access to health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services and mental health and psychosocial support services, and seek to enhance the provision of safe shelter, legal aid, long-term support, reintegration and timely family reunification, including protection and assistance, working also with civil society and other relevant partners. We will ensure that victims are treated with respect and dignity and are not inappropriately penalized or adversely affected by any actions taken by government authorities and communities, including criminal, civil, administrative and immigration penalties, for acts that they commit as a direct consequence of their trafficking situation, through the implementation of both the principle of non\u2011prosecution and non\u2011punishment of victims of trafficking subject to national laws, rules and regulations. We commit to undertake appropriate measures to facilitate access to justice and protections for victims of trafficking in persons that should not be conditional on their participation in criminal proceedings, taking into account national legislation, and we will seek to ensure that laws and policies are in place to alleviate reliance on victims\u2019 _______________ 12 See resolution 68/192.

We also commit to take steps to ensure that effective remedies are available, including for damage suffered, as well as for victims who have been unjustly penalized for illegal acts committed in connection with their victimization. We further commit to enable a victim-centred, age- and gender-sensitive approach to care and assistance of victims that takes into consideration disability and trauma and that addresses the specific needs of women, youth and children. We affirm our commitment to protect the privacy and identity and ensure the safety of victims of trafficking in persons before, during and after criminal proceedings, including when the victim\u2019s testimony is necessary in legal proceedings, and to protect immediate family members and witnesses, as appropriate, from retaliation by traffickers, by ensuring their safety, in accordance with articles 24 and 25 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as applicable. We reaffirm our commitment to continue our efforts to criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms, to hold traffickers accountable for their crimes through prosecutions, and to strengthen cooperation and coordination among Member States in countries of origin, transit and destination in order to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks involved in such crimes, inter alia through the enhancement of information- sharing, including through the secure communications channels of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), where appropriate, as well as through mutual legal assistance and extradition, with full respect for domestic law, in combating crimes that might be connected with trafficking in persons, such as money- laundering, corruption, illicit financial flows, the smuggling of migrants, the trafficking in illicit drugs, illicit arms trafficking, cybercrime and all forms of organized crime and related illicit finance. We commit to enhancing the capacity of law enforcement and criminal justice systems, including the capacity of criminal justice practitioners, to identify, investigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons, including when connected to other trafficking-related crimes, and analyse financial flows to detect and dismantle those criminal networks and their financial structures, in collaboration with financial institutions. We also commit to developing and strengthening national referral mechanisms and to use available technology to increase victim referrals and services and to identify, seize and forfeit proceeds of crime of those criminal networks. We emphasize the importance of regular and specialized professional training for officials and practitioners who are involved in preventing, identifying and responding to trafficking in persons, as a key component of an effective and victim-centred approach. We also commit to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons, and to take all appropriate measures to collect, preserve and store evidence of human trafficking, including when committed for the purpose of, particularly, sexual exploitation. We recognize that trafficking-related crimes often encompass other criminal acts and call for the adoption of prosecutorial policies that ensure accountability for the full range of harm suffered by victims. We are seriously concerned that the scale of global resourcing to prevent and fight trafficking in persons does not match the scale of the challenge and in this regard: (a) We reaffirm our strong support for the United Nations voluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, established in accordance with the Global Plan of Action, and we invite all stakeholders to contribute to the trust fund, including through the announcement of pledges at the quadrennial high-level appraisals of the Global Plan of Action; 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons A/RES/80/9 5/8 25-19346 (b) We evince our strong political will and commitment of financial resources to effectively address trafficking in persons in all circumstances, acknowledging the need to provide sufficient, reliable, sustainable and predictable resources for national trafficking in persons strategies, especially for developing countries that are particularly affected by mixed and large movements of refugees and migrants, including countries of origin, transit and destination; (c) We will endeavour to provide unearmarked extrabudgetary resources for the offices of the United Nations system which are mandated to combat trafficking in persons, consistent with their rules and procedures; (d) We stress the need to intensify international and regional cooperation, including capacity-building, exchange of best practices and know-how and technical assistance, especially for developing countries, aimed at strengthening their ability to prevent all forms of trafficking, address the special needs of victims, and to strengthen their criminal justice systems, noting the particular role of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in this regard; (e) We encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to provide assistance to Member States for training and capacity-building, upon request, including gender- and age-sensitive and victim-centred mental health and psychosocial support services, that take into consideration disability, for the recovery and reintegration of victims; (f) We reaffirm the significant role of enhanced international cooperation in preventing and combating trafficking in persons, including in the area of mutual legal assistance and extradition. We reiterate, in the strongest terms possible, the importance of strengthening collective action by Member States to end trafficking in persons, including through regional, subregional and cross-regional mechanisms, and through partnerships and initiatives with the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders, including, inter alia, regional and international organizations, the private sector, the media, academia, parliamentarians and civil society, as well as national human rights institutions where they exist, in compliance with the Paris Principles. 13 We will promote multi-stakeholder partnerships and engage the private sector and civil society in developing and implementing relevant sustainable initiatives to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, recognizing the important role played by financial institutions. We underline the work of the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and on contemporary forms of slavery, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, and other relevant special rapporteurs and representatives, in combating trafficking in persons, and welcome their continued efforts to implement the Global Plan of Action and the present Political Declaration. We also stress the need to continue to enhance the overall organization and coherence in the global efforts of the United Nations system to respond to trafficking in persons, especially in ensuring support to Member States. In this regard, while recalling the mandate of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons, we urge the Secretary-General to continue efforts to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system and to inform Member States thereof through existing reporting channels. We recognize the important role played by the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons in the United Nations system, with the United Nations _______________ 13 Resolution 48/134, annex. A/RES/80/9 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons 25-19346 6/8 Office on Drugs and Crime as its coordinator, and recognize with appreciation the ongoing efforts of its member entities in this regard. We invite the Coordination Group to continue to increase its activities related to the implementation of the Global Plan of Action and, to that end, to incorporate aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development relevant to preventing and combating trafficking in persons and to continue to advance the coordination of future activities and avoidance of duplication of efforts. We encourage the Coordination Group to continue to expand its membership to include international intergovernmental entities that have a role in addressing trafficking in persons in all regions. We reaffirm the central role of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the global fight against trafficking in persons, particularly in providing technical assistance to Member States, upon their request, to implement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, by making use of existing capacity-building tools, lessons learned from Member States and expertise available in other international organizations. We reiterate the need for improved data collection and analysis of trafficking in persons, disaggregated by sex, age, disability and other relevant factors, including the form of exploitation, and using systematic and consistent criteria, to effectively counter trafficking in persons. We thus recognize the importance of improved data collection by national authorities and will enhance international cooperation to this end, including through capacity-building, financial support and technical assistance, consistent with our national legislation on data protection, if applicable, and our respective international obligations related to privacy. We acknowledge the importance of the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime pursuant to the Global Plan of Action, and request the Office to continue to collect information on patterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, at the national, regional and international levels, in a balanced, reliable and comprehensive manner, to be published in the Global Report, and in ongoing research to estimate the prevalence of trafficking in persons, in close cooperation and collaboration with Member States. We underline that the issue of trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies requires further attention, while fully respecting the principles of humanitarian assistance. In this regard: (a) We recognize that refugees and migrants in large movements face greater risk of trafficking in persons, thus we will work to prevent trafficking among those affected by displacement, and provide support with targeted measures to identify victims or those at risk of trafficking in places of first arrival as well as throughout their journey, through the development of age- and gender-responsive policies and programmes. We also commit to intensify our efforts to prevent irregular migration and create and strengthen pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration to reduce the exposure of people on the move to trafficking in persons, recalling our respective commitments to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration; (b) We encourage the training of humanitarian and peacekeeping personnel to be deployed in humanitarian emergencies and peacekeeping operations on responding to trafficking in persons, child protection and sexual exploitation and abuse, and encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to train their personnel, build their technical capacity to assess situations and respond to instances of trafficking in persons in these contexts. We express our deep concern about the increasing links between armed groups, including terrorist groups, and trafficking in persons, involving the coercion of 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons A/RES/80/9 7/8 25-19346 victims, in particular of women and girls, into forced marriages, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, forced labour, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, and subjecting men and boys to forced labour or act as combatants. We note with concern the increasing misuse of information and communications technologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate various aspects of trafficking in persons, including the recruitment of individuals through online advertisements for online fraud and scam operations, and with the use of generative artificial intelligence, thereby subjecting victims to forced criminality, debt bondage and a range of abusive practices, as well as various forms of exploitations, including online child sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, emphasizing the disproportionate risk faced by persons with disabilities and the need to strengthen digital literacy as a preventive measure. We also emphasize the importance of countering such misuse while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with our obligations under international law. In this regard: (a) We take note of the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International Cooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information and Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in Electronic Form of Serious Crimes;14 (b) We call for the strengthening of law enforcement digital expertise and capacity to conduct proportionate, lawful, accountable and necessary investigations in cyberspace, including the dark web, and seize associated electronic evidence. We encourage the appropriate use by law enforcement of technology-based solutions that address the global scope of trafficking in persons; (c) We express deep concern about the growing misuse of artificial intelligence or machine-learning technologies to generate, disseminate hate speech for the purpose of trafficking in persons, including on social media platforms, through, inter alia, the use of artificial content, including images, videos and other forms of media, while also recognizing the potential of such technologies to detect and mitigate harmful content when developed and deployed safely; (d) We further encourage the appropriate use of technology and innovative tools by practitioners and central authorities to increase international and, where relevant, cross-border cooperation in criminal matters, recognizing the need for the ethical use of technology consistent with human rights obligations; (e) We call for effective partnerships among the public sector, civil society, academia and the private sector, including technology companies, to enhance innovation, cooperation and the use of technology, including artificial intelligence, to combat trafficking in persons. We emphasize the particularly important role played by Internet service and access providers, and call upon them to fulfil their responsibilities and promptly detect, report and remove sexual exploitation and abuse materials related to trafficking in persons, while we commit to taking legislative and other measures to facilitate these actions. We reaffirm that the crime of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal constitutes a form of exploitation and an offence against the human dignity of the victims that needs a multidisciplinary approach, based on respect for all human rights. We condemn the involvement of criminal groups and unethical medical personnel in trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and we call for better coordination and collaboration between criminal justice actors and medical professionals. We commit to adopting ethical and transparent regulations governing organ donations, strengthening legislative frameworks, including the criminalization _______________ 14 Resolution 79/243, annex. A/RES/80/9 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons 25-19346 8/8 of these practices and provisions to ensure the accountability of the perpetrators, and to resourcing such efforts. We also reaffirm the importance of preventing and combating trafficking in persons in supply chains, including by deterring and penalizing fraudulent and abusive recruitment practices. We encourage Member States, multilateral organizations and the private sector to adopt ethical and transparent practices in their procurement and supply chains, and strongly urge them to regularly disclose and provide relevant information. We are mindful of the need to ensure that all actors in global supply chains, including intermediaries, who profit from the labour of trafficking victims are to be held accountable, including through sufficiently stringent sanctions and appropriate policy and legislation. In this regard, we recall the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.15 We stress the need to establish firewalls between immigration checks and labour inspections, to implement labour standards and to improve government procurement practices to promote decent work. We emphasize the importance of awareness and education campaigns, in partnership with civil society and the media, to combat acceptance of forced labour. We also urge the Secretary-General to ensure that all United Nations procurement does not contain goods and services produced by victims of human trafficking. We acknowledge that the gaps between the Global Plan of Action and its implementation by Member States should be closed, and recognize that arrangements are needed to ensure the systematic follow-up to and review of all of the commitments we are making at the present high-level meeting, including in the quadrennial high- level meetings of the General Assembly to appraise progress achieved in the implementation of the Global Plan of Action. We will also promote the development of clearer analysis of successful counter-trafficking responses, and assessment and evaluation frameworks that include consideration of how laws, policies or practical measures affect victims of trafficking in persons. _______________ 15 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework (A/HRC/17/31, annex).", "signals": ["agenda signal", "SG signal", "follow-up signal"], "num_paragraphs": 31}, {"symbol": "A/RES/80/10", "filename": "A_RES_80_10.html", "content": "Decides to proclaim 5 September of each year as the International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous Women and Girls; Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all States Members of the United Nations, members of the specialized agencies and observers of the General Assembly, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders, for appropriate observance of the International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous Women and Girls, in order to raise awareness of the need to recognize and respect the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Indigenous women and girls, as set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and to support their pursuit of economic, social and cultural development; _______________ 11 Resolution 70/1. 12 CEDAW/C/GC/39. 13 CEDAW/C/GC/40.
