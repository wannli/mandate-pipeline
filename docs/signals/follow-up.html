                        We call for closer coordination between the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States and United Nations country teams in landlocked developing countries, as an important tool for follow-up to and review of the implementation of provisions of the Awaza Programme of Action, underlining that the Office should be provided with adequate resources to fulfil its mandate, including through the existing trust fund. We also stress the critical importance of the more proactive role of United Nations agencies, including through the United Nations resident coordinators and country teams, in mobilizing all stakeholders to help Governments of landlocked developing countries to address the challenges caused by those countries’ structural constraints.

                        We welcome the ambitious package of reforms and actions under the Sevilla Commitment to close the financing gap with urgency and catalyse sustainable development investments at scale, in which we committed to take concrete actions to enhance fiscal space, address debt challenges of developing countries and lower the cost of capital and to provide and mobilize additional, innovative, adequate, affordable, predictable and accessible financing from all sources, recognizing the comparative advantages of public and private finance. In this regard, we commit to: (a) Continue reforming the international financial architecture, enhancing its resilience, coherence and effectiveness in responding to present and future challenges and crises and making global economic governance more inclusive, representative, equitable and effective, strengthening the roles of the United Nations, international financial institutions and other relevant international organizations while recognizing their respective mandates and governance bodies, and recognizing that the international community must work together to broaden and enhance the voice and representation of developing countries in international financial and economic institutions; (b) Increasing investment in social policies, including social protection systems, inclusive education, healthcare and housing; (c) Calling upon the multilateral development banks to pay greater attention to financing for social development; (d) Ensuring fair and timely solutions to address sovereign debt challenges and debt distress and their effect on social development; Doha Political Declaration of the “World Social Summit” under the title “the Second World Summit for Social Development” A/RES/80/5 17/18 25-17700 (e) Strengthening the inclusiveness and effectiveness of international tax cooperation at the United Nations, while taking into consideration the work of other relevant forums and institutions, and continuing to engage constructively in the negotiations on the United Nations framework convention on international tax cooperation and its protocols and encourage support for the process; (f) Reiterating that Member States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing countries; (g) Reaffirming the importance of official development assistance as a key component of international development cooperation in helping developing countries achieve sustainable development and acknowledging the urgency of undertaking sustained efforts to reverse declining trends in official development assistance and urge developed countries to scale up and fulfil their respective official development assistance commitments, including the long-standing commitment by most developed countries to achieve the targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to developing countries, and between 0.15 and 0.2 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to the least developed countries; (h) Strengthening multilateral cooperation to enhance fiscal space for social spending and supporting developing countries in ensuring predictable, adequate and uninterrupted funding of social protection and other essential social spending during shocks and crises; (i) Promoting and scaling up North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation as critical modalities for mobilizing knowledge, technical cooperation and resources to address social challenges and foster innovation in social development policies while strengthening and respecting national ownership, and recognizing that South-South cooperation is a complement to, not a substitute for, North-South cooperation.

                        We acknowledge that the gaps between the Global Plan of Action and its implementation by Member States should be closed, and recognize that arrangements are needed to ensure the systematic follow-up to and review of all of the commitments we are making at the present high-level meeting, including in the quadrennial high- level meetings of the General Assembly to appraise progress achieved in the implementation of the Global Plan of Action. We will also promote the development of clearer analysis of successful counter-trafficking responses, and assessment and evaluation frameworks that include consideration of how laws, policies or practical measures affect victims of trafficking in persons. _______________ 15 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework (A/HRC/17/31, annex).
